And saurik for the build system that is based on:
http://svn.telesphoreo.org/trunk/data/

I often reference those links to avoid wasting time on already solved problems;
I used Saurik's stuff a lot when Bingner haven't released his stuff publicly (true OG).

Perl and OpenSSL are heavily based on those sources.

=========================================

I'm rebuilding libs that might be featured on Unc0ver and
Electra due to the fact that it's easier to compile with my own libs and
compatibility reasons. Often static files and pkg-config files are removed.

It might be possible to support lower iOS jailbreaks, but lzma is outdated so therefore is the issue/barrier.
gzip should be fine, I don't know how the compression plays out.


=======================================

Toolchain not provided (yet?) nor the extra things needed to make everything work.

Speed up building (be warned some things don't like be built in parallel):
CORES=$(grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo)
export MAKEFLAGS="-j $CORES"
