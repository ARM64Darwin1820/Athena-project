.SH "NAME"
.LP 
.B realpath
\- returns the canonicalized absolute pathname.
.SH "USAGE"
.LP 
.B realpath
<full or partial pathname>
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
.B realpath
calls the realpath(3) function to resolve all symbolic links, extra ``/''
characters and references to /./ and /../ in pathname, and prints the
resulting absolute pathname to the standard output.
.P
The
.B realpath
command will resolve both absolute and relative paths and return the
absolute pathname corresponding to the input pathname.  (If your system's
realpath(3) function does not return the absolute path then
.B realpath
will not either. Most will return the absolute path, but some versions of Solaris have been
reported not to. See realpath(3) for details.) All but the last component of
pathname must exist when
.B realpath
is called.
.P
.B realpath
is especially useful for shell scripts.
.P
If no command line arguments are given then
.B realpath
will read from standard input, and thus it can be used in pipes. Standard
input will be processed one line at a time, which each path on each line
being resolved separately.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
The following sets the shell variable FOO to /usr/bin/false
           #create a symlink(1) on ls in /tmp/bar
           ln -s /usr/bin/false /tmp/bar
           FOO=`realpath /tmp/bar`

.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.B realpath
returns zero on success. Upon failure
.B realpath
prints the name of the path which caused the error followed by the error
description to standard error. Then
.B realpath 
returns the numeric error code of the error, which will always be greater
than zero.
