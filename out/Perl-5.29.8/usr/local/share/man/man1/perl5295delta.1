Now, adding the verbose flag (\f(CW\*(C`\-Dv\*(C'\fR) to the \f(CW\*(C`\-Dr\*(C'\fR flag turns on all
possible regular expression debugging.

Regular expression pattern matching of things like \f(CW\*(C`qr/[^\f(CIa\f(CW]/\*(C'\fR is
significantly sped up, where \fIa\fR is any \s-1ASCII\s0 character.  Which classes
will get this speed up is complicated and depends on the underlying bit
patterns of those characters, so differs between \s-1ASCII\s0 and \s-1EBCDIC\s0
platforms, but all case pairs, like \f(CW\*(C`qr/[Gg]/\*(C'\fR are included, as is
\&\f(CW\*(C`[^01]\*(C'\fR.

Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

\fIperlfunc\fR

Normally the thread-safe functions are used only on threaded builds.
It is now possible to force their use on unthreaded builds on systems
that have them available, by including the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-Accflags=\*(Aq\-DUSE_THREAD_SAFE_LOCALE\*(Aq\*(C'\fR option to \fIConfigure\fR.
.SH "Testing"
.IX Header "Testing"
Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes
in this release.

.IX Header "Platform Support"
.SS "Platform-Specific Notes"
.IX Subsection "Platform-Specific Notes"
.IP "Mac \s-1OS X\s0" 4
.IX Item "Mac OS X"
Perl's build and testing process on Mac \s-1OS X\s0 for \f(CW\*(C`\-Duseshrplib\*(C'\fR
builds is now compatible with Mac \s-1OS X\s0 System Integrity Protection
(\s-1SIP\s0).
.Sp
\&\s-1SIP\s0 prevents binaries in \fI/bin\fR (and a few other places) being passed
the \f(CW\*(C`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\*(C'\fR environment variable.  For our purposes this
prevents \f(CW\*(C`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\*(C'\fR from being passed to the shell, which
prevents that variable being passed to the testing or build process,
so running \f(CW\*(C`perl\*(C'\fR couldn't find \fIlibperl.dylib\fR.
.Sp
To workaround that, the initial build of the \fIperl\fR executable
expects to find \fIlibperl.dylib\fR in the build directory, and the
library path is then adjusted during installation to point to the
installed library.

SDBM_File is now more robust with corrupt database files.  The
improvements do not make \s-1SDBM\s0 files suitable as an interchange format.

.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`binmode($fh);\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`binmode($fh, \*(Aq:raw\*(Aq);\*(C'\fR now properly removes the
\&\f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR flag from the default \f(CW\*(C`:crlf\*(C'\fR I/O layer on Win32.  [perl

The experimental reference aliasing feature was misinterpreting array and
hash slice assignment as being localised, e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    \e(@a[3,5,7]) = \e(....);
.Ve
.Sp
was being interpreted as:

Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.29.5:

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the \s-1CPAN\s0 modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire \s-1CPAN\s0 community for
helping Perl to flourish.

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at <https://rt.perl.org/>.  There may also be information at
<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
\&\*(L"\s-1SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION\*(R"\s0 in perlsec
for details of how to report the issue.

you can do so by running the \f(CW\*(C`perlthanks\*(C'\fR program:
