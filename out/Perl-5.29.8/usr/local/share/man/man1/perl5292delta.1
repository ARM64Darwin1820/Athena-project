For details, see <https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/>.
.PP
The Word_Break property, as in past Perl releases, remains tailored to
behave more in line with expectations of Perl users.  This means that
sequential runs of horizontal white space characters are not broken
apart, but kept as a single run.  Unicode 11 changed from past versions
to be more in line with Perl, but it left several white space characters
as causing breaks: \s-1TAB, NO BREAK SPACE,\s0 and \s-1FIGURE SPACE\s0 (U+2007).  We
have decided to continue to use the previous Perl tailoring with regards
to these.
.PP
As of July 2018, another aspect of Unicode 11.0 is causing problems, and
that is the changing the Georgian script to have both lower and
uppercase letters.  It turns out that many devices do not have fonts
installed that can display the new uppercase letters, and people using
Georgian are finding their text more or less illegible.  It is being
suggested that implementations delay their adoption of this portion of
11.0.
.PP
But since the next stable release of Perl is almost a year away, this
aspect of 11.0 is being left in, with the option to back it out if
things haven't improved by that time, or if we get too many complaints
about the development release being unusable for Georgian users.

Perl 5.29.2 represents approximately 4 weeks of development since Perl
5.29.1 and contains approximately 59,000 lines of changes across 240 files
from 15 authors.
.PP
Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 47,000 lines of changes to 130 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.
.PP
Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.29.2:
.PP
Aaron Crane, Chad Granum, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, Daniel
Dragan, David Mitchell, H.Merijn Brand, James E Keenan, Karl Williamson,
Sawyer X, Sisyphus, Steve Hay, Tomasz Konojacki, Tony Cook, Unicode
Consortium.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.
.PP
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the \s-1CPAN\s0 modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire \s-1CPAN\s0 community for
helping Perl to flourish.

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at <https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
\&\*(L"\s-1SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION\*(R"\s0 in perlsec
for details of how to report the issue.
.SH "Give Thanks"

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the \f(CW\*(C`perlthanks\*(C'\fR program:
