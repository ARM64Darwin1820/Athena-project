Perl 5.29.3 represents approximately 4 weeks of development since Perl
5.29.2 and contains approximately 150,000 lines of changes across 190 files
from 15 authors.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 140,000 lines of changes to 92 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.
.PP
Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.29.3:
.PP
Andy Dougherty, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dagfinn Ilmari MannsA\*~Xker, David
Mitchell, Eugen Konkov, Graham Knop, H.Merijn Brand, James E Keenan, John \s-1SJ\s0
Anderson, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Sawyer X, Slaven Rezic, Steve
Hay, Sullivan Beck, Tony Cook.
.PP
The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.
.PP
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the \s-1CPAN\s0 modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire \s-1CPAN\s0 community for
helping Perl to flourish.

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at <https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
\&\*(L"\s-1SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION\*(R"\s0 in perlsec
for details of how to report the issue.
.SH "Give Thanks"
.IX Header "Give Thanks"
If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the \f(CW\*(C`perlthanks\*(C'\fR program:
