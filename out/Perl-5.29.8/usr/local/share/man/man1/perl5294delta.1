This document describes differences between the 5.29.3 release and the 5.29.4
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.29.2, first read
perl5293delta, which describes differences between 5.29.2 and 5.29.3.

The meaning of an unbounded upper quantifier \f(CW"{m,}"\fR remains unchanged.
It matches 2**31 \- 1 times on most platforms, and more on ones where a C
language short variable is more than 4 bytes long.

.ie n .SS "Assigning non-zero to $[ is fatal"
.el .SS "Assigning non-zero to \f(CW$[\fP is fatal"
.IX Subsection "Assigning non-zero to $[ is fatal"
Setting \f(CW$[\fR to a non-zero value has been deprecated since
Perl 5.12 and now throws a fatal error.
See "Assigning non-zero to \f(CW$[\fR is fatal" in perldeprecation.
.SS "Previously deprecated \fBsysread()\fP/\fBsyswrite()\fP on :utf8 handles now fatal"
.IX Subsection "Previously deprecated sysread()/syswrite() on :utf8 handles now fatal"
Calling \fBsysread()\fR, \fBsyswrite()\fR, \fBsend()\fR or \fBrecv()\fR on a \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR handle,
whether applied explicitly or implicitly, is now fatal.  This was
deprecated in perl 5.24.
.PP
There were two problems with calling these functions on \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR
handles:
.IP "\(bu" 4
All four functions only paid attention to the \f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR flag.  Other
layers were completely ignored, so a handle with
\&\f(CW\*(C`:encoding(UTF\-16LE)\*(C'\fR layer would be treated as \s-1UTF\-8.\s0  Other layers,
such as compression are completely ignored with or without the
\&\f(CW\*(C`:utf8\*(C'\fR flag.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBsysread()\fR and \fBrecv()\fR would read from the handle, skipping any
validation by the layers, and do no validation of their own.  This
could lead to invalidly encoded perl scalars.
.PP
[perl #125760]
.SS "\fBmy()\fP in false conditional prohibited"
.IX Subsection "my() in false conditional prohibited"
Declarations such as \f(CW\*(C`my $x if 0\*(C'\fR are no longer permitted.

These special variables, long deprecated, now throw exceptions when used.

.SS "Fatalize unqualified use of \fBdump()\fP"

sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
