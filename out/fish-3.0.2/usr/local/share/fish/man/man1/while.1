.SS "Description"
\fCwhile\fP repeatedly executes \fCCONDITION\fP, and if the exit status is 0, then executes \fCCOMMANDS\fP\&.
.PP
The exit status of the while loop is the exit status of the last iteration of the \fCCOMMANDS\fP executed, or 0 if none were executed\&. (This matches other shells and is POSIX-compatible\&.)
.PP
You can use \fC\fCand\fP\fP or \fC\fCor\fP\fP for complex conditions\&. Even more complex control can be achieved with \fCwhile true\fP containing a \fCbreak\fP\&.
.SS "Example"
.PP
.nf

\fBwhile\fP test -f foo\&.txt; \fBor\fP \fBtest\fP -f bar\&.txt ; \fBecho\fP file exists; \fBsleep\fP 10; \fBend\fP
  outputs 'file exists' at 10 second intervals as long as the file foo\&.txt or bar\&.txt exists\&.
